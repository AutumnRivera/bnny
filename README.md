# Bnny

This is a simple web application that I'm working on as a fun side project.

License information for this software can be found in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). All of the other projects referenced in the build steps are licensed under an MIT license as well.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

- Run the app in development mode with `npm start`

- Build the application with `npm run build`

- Launch the test runner with `npm test`

- Run the application's linter with `npm run lint`

## Building Bnny

While you can simply build the application using the node configuration `npm run build`, there are some sub applications you will need to setup first.

Simply navigate to the `public` directory and clone with following repositories into the following directories.

- `https://github.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-src` -> `5eTools`

Once they are cloned into the correct directories, run `npm run build`, and presto! Copy the build directory into anywhere you can host a website.
